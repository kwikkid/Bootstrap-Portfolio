			<p>Product manager by day, dev student by night, Lynne has been a bay area resident for most of her life. Graduated UC Riverside with a degree in Medical Biology in 2011, and studied in Shanghai's Fudan University in the Spring of 2012. She began working at Proteus Digital Health, a health tech company that specializes in digitizing medicine for perscription adherence and became familiar with FDA and ISO lab and manufacturing regulations. She took those skills and became a full time Quality Manager at Steep Hill Labs, the world's first and largest Cannabis Testing Laboratory. She implemented new QA and QC processes and changed the company's attitude towards quality and continuous improvement. Her last three years at Steep Hill, she learned a lot about Steep Hill's product, services, and customers and became Steep Hill's first Product Manager. She is now a Product Manager at Invitae, a genetic diagnostic laboratory where she maintains and executes her vision on Lab Information Management Software (LIMS) allowing Invitae to scale and drive volume.
			</p>
			<p> During her free time, she enjoys finding flight deals and planning her next trip. When she's in the bay area, she enjoys going to the gym at UCSF Mission Bay, doing yoga, and finding new restaurants to try. She's currently a part-time student at UC Berkeley's Full Stack Development course with the goal of adding more skills and value to her teams.</p>
